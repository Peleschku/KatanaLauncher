Hello!
This is a launcher tool that I created for Katana that shoud ideally help people launch Katana with Prman, Arnold and other Environment variables without needing to use a .bat launcher script. At the moment, this works best when launched from an IDE (I havent packaged it up as a .exe yet), and requires PyQt5 as a prerequisite!

The Launcher can be launched via IDE from `katanaLauncher\katanaLauncher.py` . Feel free to ignore anything in the practice folder!

Enjoy!
